# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis – SQL (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This section covers the **SQL analysis** performed on the Superstore dataset using **MySQL**.  
The dataset was first cleaned and explored using **Python**, and then loaded into MySQL as part of an **ETL workflow** for structured, query-based analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this SQL analysis is to:
- Answer key **business questions** using SQL
- Validate insights derived from Python EDA
- Analyze sales, profit, discount impact, and regional performance
- Create **reusable SQL views** for reporting and dashboards
