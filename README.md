# Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis – Python EDA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Superstore dataset using Python to understand sales performance, profitability, and discount impact.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLAlchemy

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned and preprocessed data
- Converted date columns and created new features:
  - Shipping Days
  - Profit Margin
- Performed EDA to analyze:
  - Sales & profit distribution
  - Loss-making categories and sub-categories
  - Impact of discounts on profit
- Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Loaded cleaned data into MySQL using Python (ETL flow)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Sales distribution is right-skewed with few high-value orders
- High discounts negatively impact profitability
- Certain sub-categories consistently generate losses

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Advanced SQL analysis
- Power BI dashboard creation
