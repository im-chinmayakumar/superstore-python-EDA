# Superstore End-to-End Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** using the Superstore dataset to derive actionable business insights through **Python, MySQL, SQL, and Power BI**.

Python is used for **data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The transformed data is then loaded into **MySQL** using Python libraries as part of an **ETL process**.  
SQL is leveraged to answer structured business questions, and **Power BI** is used to visualize insights through interactive dashboards.
